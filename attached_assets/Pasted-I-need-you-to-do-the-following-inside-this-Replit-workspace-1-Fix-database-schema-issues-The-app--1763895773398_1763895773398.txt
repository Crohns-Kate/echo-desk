I need you to do the following inside this Replit workspace:

1. Fix database schema issues
The app crashes on render/deploy because the tenants table is missing several columns:

parking_text

services_text

first_visit_text

about_text

health_text

faq_json

Please:

Detect which of these columns are missing

Add them via SQL using the $DATABASE_URL

Do NOT try to use drizzle-kit (it is breaking)

Use a single ALTER TABLE with IF NOT EXISTS

Example format:

ALTER TABLE tenants
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS parking_text TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS services_text TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS first_visit_text TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS about_text TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS health_text TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS faq_json JSONB;

Run this command safely using psql "$DATABASE_URL".

2. Verify tenant routing
The tenant “spinalogic” exists, but Twilio calls still say “Your Clinic.”
Please:

Print all rows from tenants

Confirm slug = 'spinalogic'

Confirm phone_number = '+61468035585'

Ensure matching logic in server/services/tenantRouter.ts works

Fix any mismatches

3. Confirm FAQ + knowledgebase
The AI is NOT answering:

“What are your hours?”

“Where are you located?”

“What services do you offer?”

“Do you have parking?”

Please:

Ensure knowledgebase for spinalogic loads from server/knowledgebase/*.md

Ensure getKnowledgeContextForAI() passes correct tenantId

Test a simulated query in the console

Fix any missing connections in dialogueManager or knowledgeResponder

4. Improve yes/no detection
The system only reacts to “yes” — please update logic so:

“ok”

“okay”

“yep”

“sure”

“please”
all count as affirmative.

5. Run full health check
Check:

All routes compile

All tenant routing paths respond correctly

No TypeScript errors

No missing environment variables

No missing files in knowledgebase

Then provide:

Summary of what you fixed

Remaining issues I need to test manually

Work autonomously — do not ask for confirmation for each step.
Just complete the whole pipeline and report when done.
