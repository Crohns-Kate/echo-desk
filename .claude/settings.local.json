This caused a 500 error.\n\nThe correct approach is to use the Recordings API, but with a delay\nto ensure the call is fully established and in \"in-progress\" state.\n\nChanges:\n- Removed incorrect <Start> verb usage\n- Added 2-second setTimeout delay before starting recording\n- This allows call to be fully connected before recording begins\n- Should resolve \"not eligible for recording\" errors\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
